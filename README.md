🌍 Why It Matters

Disasters and pandemics expose the fragility of outpatient healthcare. People need to find the right care—urgently, accurately, and privately—often without an internet connection. HealthSight bridges this gap by combining Gemma 3n’s on-device AI with offline GIS intelligence, enabling access to critical care guidance—anywhere, anytime.
